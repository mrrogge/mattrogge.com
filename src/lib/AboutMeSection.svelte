    <h2 class="text-4xl text-center">ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>Throughout my life, I have consistently demonstrated a knack for problem-solving. From a young age, I expressed a natural curiosity for finding solutions to challenges. As a child, I started writing simple BASIC programs on my parents' home computer. This developed into a lifelong fascination with programming that continues to this day.</p>
    <p>While studying electrical engineering at the University of Minnesota, I started my
        controls engineering career as a co-op student with PaR Systems. This led to a
        full-time position where I honed my skills in system design and PLC programming. </p>
    <p>I've had the pleasure of working on many fascinating projects throughout my
        career. I strive to cast a wide net, learning about a variety of applications
        and technologies. Past projects have included aerospace, adhesive materials, food
        processing and packaging, fluid handling...even pig farming!</p>
    <p>I love learning new techniques, taking on challenges, and seeing disjointed parts become whole. There's really no better feeling. </p>
    <p class="text-2xl font-bold text-center text-sky-800">Hard work. Integrity. Honesty.</p>
    <p class="text-2xl text-center">These are my values.</p>
